This project will be to figure out how to combine multiple sine waves together
into one wave so that one AudioStream instance can play multiple notes at once.

In order to accomplish this, the following will need to be done:
  Learn how to modify amplitude to generate beat frequencies

Each frequency of sine wave will need to be added together to generate the new
since wave frequency, and then the amplitudes of each frequency will also need
to be added and the audio stream will need to be modified in a way to produce
the beat frequencies.
